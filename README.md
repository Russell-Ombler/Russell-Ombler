### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

"I am Russell from East Yorkshire, United Kingdom, and I am currently studying Web Development with HyperionDev. I am thoroughly enjoying the course, which covers a wide range of topics, including HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, JavaScript, Object-Oriented Programming, DOM Manipulation, JSON and AJAX with Fetch, NodeJS, React, Databases, and the MongoDB Database. Additionally, the course teaches authenticating with JWT, which is a valuable skill for any web developer."
